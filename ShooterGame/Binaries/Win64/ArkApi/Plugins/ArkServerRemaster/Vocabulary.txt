InfoNote_BPUpgrades="Blueprint Upgrading Information:\n\nCreate a folder named one of the following:\n\n   Upgrade\n   Upgrade Damage\n   Upgrade Armor\n   Upgrade Thermals\n   Upgrade Durability\n   Upgrade Revise\n\nThen place a blueprint in the 'Upgrade' folder, and simply craft the blueprint from there to attempt upgrading the specified stat.  If no stat is specified in the 'Upgrade' folder name, the upgrades will be evenly applied to all relevant item stats at a reduced rate.  If 'Revise' is specified, no upgrades will be attempted, and the blueprint's Efficiency Rating will be rerolled instead, altering the amount of resources needed to craft it for better or worse, influenced by your crafting skill.\n\nOnce you have upgraded a blueprint as much as your current crafting skill allows, continuing to craft the blueprint from within an 'Upgrade' folder will simply reroll its Efficiency Rating.  If you are satisfied with a blueprint's Efficiency Rating, simply remove it from the 'Upgrade' folder and any further crafts will function as normal, leaving its rating unchanged.\n"
